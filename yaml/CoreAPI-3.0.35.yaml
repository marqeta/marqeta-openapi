      The account holder group is a Marqeta platform resource that allows you to configure multiple account holders (user and/or business resources) as a group.
      It allows certain settings to be selectively applied, depending on whether or not an account holder has passed verification (KYC).

      You associate an account holder with an account holder group using the optional `account_holder_group_token` field in the user or business resource.
      Any account holder that you do not explicitly associate with a group is automatically associated with the program's default account holder group.
      The default group's name is "Default account holder group", its token is `DEFAULT_AHG`, and its configuration uses the default configuration values.

      An authorization control limits spending by specified users at specified merchants.
      You can limit spending at a single merchant or at a group of merchants, and you can limit spending by a single user, users with a particular card product, or all users.

      You can block spending at all merchants by default and then allow it for specific merchants, or you can allow spending at all merchants by default and block it at specific merchants.

      [TIP]
      See <</developer-guides/controlling-spending, Controlling Spending>> for a tutorial that walks you through the creation of a spend control, as well as links to more information about merchant category codes.

      Auto reload enables you to automatically load a specified amount into an account when the account balance falls below a defined threshold.

      Auto reloads execute only when the account balance falls below the trigger value due to spending.
      They do not execute due to unloading of funds or because of lack of funds when a user or business is first created.

      You can define auto reloads at the level of an account holder, a card product, or a program.
      Each auto reload draws from a single funding source.

      In the case of auto reloads defined at more than one level, the following order of precedence (first to last) determines which auto reload is executed:

      . Account holder
      . Card product
      . Program
    name: Auto Reload

      Use the `/balances` endpoint to retrieve the following general purpose account (GPA) balance details for a user or business:

      * *Ledger balance* - When using standard funding: The funds that are available to spend immediately, including funds from any authorized transactions that have not yet cleared.
      When using Just-in-Time (JIT) Funding: Authorized funds that are currently on hold, but not yet cleared.
      * *Available balance* - The ledger balance minus any authorized transactions that have not yet cleared.
      Also known as the cardholder's purchasing power.
      If you are using JIT Funding, this balance is usually 0.00.
      * *Cached balance* - Not currently used.
      * *Credit balance* - Not currently used.
      * *Pending credits* - ACH loads that have been accepted, but for which the funding time has not yet elapsed.

      Use the `/banktransfers` endpoint to move funds between your program funding or cardholder account and an external account over the ACH Network.
      This kind of bank transfer is also known as ACH origination.

      You can create the following types of transfers:

      * *Push* funds from your program funding or cardholder account to an external account.
      * *Pull* funds from your external account into your program funding or cardholder account.

      You must have an existing bank account at a US bank to fund or receive funds from your Marqeta account.
      To add an external program funding source account to the Marqeta platform, send a `POST` request to the `/fundingsources/program/ach` endpoint to PUSH or PULL money from or to the Program Funding Account.
      To add an external account holder funding source account to the Marqeta platform, send a `POST` request to the `/fundingsources/ach` endpoint to PUSH or PULL money from or to the Cardholder Account.

      Use the `/bulkissuances` endpoint to order physical payment cards in bulk.

      For more information on cards, card products, and bulk card ordering, see <</developer-guides/about-cards, About Cards>>.

      Some attributes of the `bulkissuance` object can also be defined in an associated `card` or `cardproduct` object.
      If you define one of these attributes in more than one object, the Marqeta platform applies an order of precedence to determine which attribute to use at fulfillment time.
      The order of precedence is as follows:

      . `card`
      . `bulkissuance`
      . `cardproduct`

      Defining an attribute in an object with higher precedence does not overwrite the same attribute in a lower-precedence object; the Marqeta platform ignores these lower-precedence attributes.

      For more information on cards, see <</developer-guides/about-cards, About Cards>>.

      A business is a type of account holder that cannot directly hold cards, but can have parent/child relationships with card-holding users.
      A business can monitor and control card use by a specified group of users.
      Every business has a general purpose account (GPA).

      For information on how to create a user that has a child-to-parent hierarchical relationship to the business, see <</core-api/users#_create_user, Create User>>.

      [NOTE]
      A user can simultaneously be a child of a business and a parent of other users if the user is not configured to use the parent's account balances and the user's children are configured to use the parent's account balances.

      The card products resource represents the behavior and functionality of one or more cards (either physical or virtual).
      For example, attributes of the card product determine whether the associated cards can be used at an ATM and/or online and whether they are currently enabled.
      For physical cards, the card product determines color and other printing specifications for when the cards are manufactured and personalized.
      You can optionally associate authorization controls and/or velocity controls with card products to restrict where and how associated cards are used.

      If your program is Managed by Marqeta, then Marqeta will create the card products for your production environment.

      Some attributes of the `cardproduct` object can also be defined in an associated `bulkissuance` or `card` object.
      If you define one of these attributes in more than one object, the Marqeta platform applies an order of precedence to determine which attribute to use at fulfillment time.
      The order of precedence is as follows:

      . `card`
      . `bulkissuance`
      . `cardproduct`

      Defining an attribute in an object with higher precedence does not overwrite the same attribute in a lower-precedence object; the Marqeta platform ignores these lower-precedence attributes.

      For more information on cards, see <</developer-guides/about-cards, About Cards>>.

      The `card` resource represents a payment card.
      Cards are derived from and controlled by the `cardproduct` resource.
      For more information on cards, see <</developer-guides/about-cards, About Cards>>.

      Some attributes of the `card` resource can be defined in an associated `bulkissuance` or `cardproduct` resource.
      If you define one of these attributes in more than one object, the order of precedence at fulfillment time is as follows:

      . `card`
      . `bulkissuance`

      Commando Mode is a fallback measure that ensures Gateway JIT-funded cards continue to function in the event that your system fails.
      If your system cannot respond to the JIT Funding request, the Marqeta platform makes a decision in your place based on defined business rules.
      The Marqeta platform stores any unsent webhooks for later transmission, ensuring that the card state and account balances on your system correspond with activity that occurred while Commando Mode was in effect.

      You can identify transactions that were funded while Commando Mode was in effect by examining the `subnetwork` field of the transaction record.

      * A `subnetwork` value of `GATEWAY_JIT` indicates that the transaction was funded through normal Gateway JIT Funding and that Commando Mode was not in effect at the time.
      * A value of `MANAGED_JIT` indicates that the transaction was funded while Commando Mode was in effect.
      In addition, the `standin_approved_by` field has a value of `COMMANDO_AUTO` or `COMMANDO_MANUAL` when Commando Mode is enabled for a transaction.

      When `COMMANDO_MANUAL` is configured, all transactions are processed via Commando Mode.
      When `COMMANDO_AUTO` is configured, Commando Mode is enabled only when a transaction times out or encounters an error.

      While Commando Mode is a form of Stand-in Processing (STIP), it is different than network STIP.
      Network STIP occurs when the card network cannot communicate with the Marqeta platform.
      Transactions handled by network STIP include the `standin_approved_by` field with a value of `NETWORK`.

      Commando Mode and Managed JIT Funding are functionally equivalent.
      See <</developer-guides/about-jit-funding, About Just-in-Time Funding>> for more information.

      [NOTE]
      Commando Mode requires additional configuration.
      To configure Commando Mode control sets, contact your Marqeta representative.

      Credit substatuses can be applied to credit accounts or credit account holders.
      Substatuses should be applied only after verification with Customer Support and after the cardholder request for the substatus designation has been accepted.
      Substatuses define specific circumstances, such as bankruptcy, hardship or fraud.
      They also affect account behavior or activity, including interest accrual, authorization requests, and account termination.
      Substatus downstream account actions are not always reversible for the cardholder, which means that substatuses should be applied with caution.

      Use the substatus endpoints to apply or remove a substatus for a credit account or user.
      Applying a substatus causes immediate downstream changes to the account.
      For additional information about substatuses, see <</developer-guides/about-credit-accounts#_account-substatuses,Account substatuses>> or <</developer-guides/about-credit-accounts#_account-holder-substatuses,Account holder substatuses>> in the <</developer-guides/about-credit-accounts,About Credit Accounts>> guide.

      [NOTE]

      A fee charge moves funds from the general purpose account (GPA) of an account holder to your program's fee account.
      The charge amount is determined by the fee that is assessed.
      The request returns an error if the GPA has insufficient funds to cover the fee.
      This behavior contrasts with assessing a fee using the `/gpaorders` endpoint, in which case the amount of the fee is loaded into the GPA from the funding source before the GPA is debited.

      A `fees` resource represents a monetary assessment against an account holder's general purpose account (GPA).
      Assessing a fee transfers funds from the account holder's GPA account to your program's fee account.
      By default, every account has a GPA account used for the funding of transfers.

      You can assess fees either post-transaction or in real time.
      Real-time fee assessment ensures the account has sufficient funds available to cover both the transaction amount and the fee before authorization of the transaction.
      To assess fees in real time, you must create a real-time fee group using the `/realtimefeegroups` endpoint.

      When assessing a post-transaction fee, you can either debit existing GPA funds, or pull in new funds from a funding source.
      To use existing GPA funds, use the `/feetransfers` endpoint.
      To pull in new funds, use the fees array in `/gpaorders`.

      [NOTE]
      If your program uses Gateway JIT Funding, you cannot assess fees.

      A merchant category code (MCC) is a four-digit number assigned by card networks to a business based on the goods or services offered by the business.
      On the Marqeta platform, an MCC group defines a set of MCCs.
      You can include an MCC group within a spend control to limit user spending at a set of merchants.

      An MCC group also allows you to automatically increase authorization amounts and to control the expiration of authorizations for the specified MCCs.
      By default, these controls apply to all cards in your program.
      An MCC group authorization control can have exceptions defined at the card product level.

      A program transfer moves funds from an account holder's general purpose account (GPA) to a program funding source.
      In contrast to a fee transfer, the program transfer amount is specified by the transfer itself and can therefore be set dynamically.
      An auto reload is triggered if the GPA has insufficient funds to cover the transfer amount and auto reload is enabled.

      [NOTE]
      The `/programtransfers` endpoint is only available for specific, pre-approved use cases.
      For more information about this endpoint, contact your Marqeta representative.

      Marqeta enables you to assess fees in real time through the use of real-time fee groups.
      A real-time fee group is a collection of fees associated with an account holder group (and thereby associated with the users and businesses that are part of that account holder group).
      Real-time fee assessment ensures that associated accounts have sufficient funds available to cover both the transaction amount and the fee before authorization of a transaction.

      Before you create a real-time fee group, you must create the individual fees (using the `/fees` endpoint) and the account holder group with which you will associate the real-time fee group (using the `/accountholdergroups` endpoint).
      Each fee in the group must be applicable to a different transaction type.
      For example, one fee could assess $1 on authorization transactions while another assesses $2 on PIN-debit transactions.

      Use of real-time fee groups requires prior approval by Marqeta.
      If you are interested in using this feature for your card program, contact your Marqeta representative for more information.

      [NOTE]
      If your program uses Gateway JIT Funding, you cannot assess fees.

      The `/transactions` resource represents the electronic messages that carry information used for payment processing.
      A transaction usually originates when a cardholder attempts to make a payment, either online or at a physical point of sale.

      You can receive information about transactions as they occur by configuring webhooks.
      Learn about configuring webhooks in the <</developer-guides/about-webhooks, About Webhooks>> guide.
      See the transaction events for which you can set up webhooks in the <</core-api/event-types, Event Types>> API reference page.

      You can also retrieve transactions associated with specific cards, merchants, and account holders using the endpoints described here.

      For an overview of transactions and the `transaction` object, including the complete list of <</developer-guides/about-transactions#_transaction_response_codes, transaction response codes>>, see <</developer-guides/about-transactions, About Transactions>>.

      [TIP]

      The `users` resource represents a person who accesses Marqeta-administered funds via a Marqeta card (whether physical or virtual).
      This endpoint enables you to create and manage users on the Marqeta platform.

      This resource stores user attributes such as name, address, and date of birth, as well as financial information such as balances.
      By default, every user automatically has a general purpose account (GPA) that is used for the funding of transfers and is therefore an `account holder`.
      Note that account balances reside at the account holder level — there are no separate `account` or `balance` objects.

      You can use the `/users` endpoint to create parent-child relationships between two users (where one user is the parent and the other is the child) or between a business and a user (where the business is the parent and the user is the child).
      This relationship provides reporting to the parent about how cards of children are used and enables the parent to monitor and even restrict card usage.

      [NOTE]
      A user can simultaneously be a child of a business and a parent of other users if the user is not configured to use a parent's account balances and the user's child is configured to use a parent's account balances.

      A velocity control limits how much users can spend.
      You can configure velocity controls to limit how much users can spend and the number of transactions they can make in a given span of time.
      You can apply velocity controls to a single user, to all users associated with a particular card product, or to all users in your program.

      Only Program Managers can create or modify program-wide velocity controls.
      A `POST` or `PUT` call from a role that does not have Program Manager permissions will receive a 403 error if its `association` field is null, or if it includes all of the fields in the request body.
      Avoid this by passing a valid `user_token` or `card_product_token` in the velocity control's `association` object, indicating that the request is specific to a user or card product, and not program-wide.
      You should also only include the specific fields you want to update, because a `PUT` or `POST` with values for all fields is interpreted as a change that requires Program Manager permissions.

      See <</developer-guides/controlling-spending, Controlling Spending>> for a tutorial that walks you through the creation of a spend control.

      [NOTE]
      Each program supports a maximum of 90 spend controls (velocity controls and <</core-api/authorization-controls, authorization controls>> combined).
      The limit of 90 spend controls applies at the program level only; it does not affect the number of user-level spend controls you can use.

      Webhooks are notifications about API events, sent as they occur.
      The Marqeta platform sends these notifications to an endpoint that is hosted in your environment and configured to receive and process them.

      Create a webhook object to represent your webhook endpoint.
      Configure it with the URL of your webhook endpoint and a set of credentials for accessing that endpoint.
      You can configure it to send notifications for a single event, a group of events by type, or all event types.
      To set up multiple webhook endpoints and route different types of event notifications to each, create multiple webhook objects and configure each to send a specific type of event notification to a specific endpoint.

      See <</developer-guides/about-webhooks, About Webhooks>> for information on notifications and a tutorial that walks you through the configuration of your webhook endpoint.

      See <</core-api/event-types, Event Types>> for reference documentation on the types of events that the Marqeta platform supports.

        Creates or updates a personal identification number (PIN) for an existing card.
        Although cardholders might choose a four-, five-, or six-digit PIN if they set their PIN at an automated teller machine, they can only set a four-digit PIN using Marqeta's Set PIN widget or the create or update PIN endpoint (`PUT /pins`).
        Cardholders can update their PIN through the API regardless of its length, but the new PIN value they choose must contain four digits.

        If you want to manage a card's PIN, first create a new control token for the card by sending a `POST` request to `/pins/controltoken`, and then use that token to update the PIN.
        You must create a card before you can manage a PIN.

        Unless PIN reveal functionality has been enabled for your program, you cannot retrieve a PIN that has previously been created.
        If the PIN has been forgotten, you must either update the card's PIN or create a new card and PIN.

        If you have enabled PIN reveal functionality for your program, you can send a `POST` request to the `/pins/reveal` endpoint to retrieve an existing PIN.
        See <</core-api/pins#revealPins, Reveal PIN>> on this page for details.

        [WARNING]
        Sending a request to this endpoint requires PCI DSS compliance.
        You must comply with PCI DSS data security requirements if you want to store, transmit, or process sensitive card data such as the cardholder's primary account number (PAN), personal identification number (PIN), and card expiration date.

        Creates a control token necessary when creating or updating a card's personal identification number (PIN).

        Creating, updating, or revealing a card's PIN is a two-step process.
        You must first create the control token that is required to create the PIN, and then you create, update, or reveal the PIN itself.

        The lifespan of the control token in a production environment is either five minutes or one hour from creation, depending on the token type.
        If multiple tokens are requested for a single card, only the most recent one is valid.
        Once redeemed, a token cannot be reused.

        Reveals the personal identification number (PIN) of an existing, active card.
        Be aware that while a cardholder can only set a four-digit PIN using the Marqeta Set PIN widget or `PUT /pins` API, you may see a four-, five-, or six-digit PIN in cases where your cardholders have set a new PIN at an automated teller machine.

        [WARNING]
        Only use this endpoint to access a PIN in order to reveal it to its cardholder.
        Do not use this endpoint for the purpose of storing a PIN at any location.

        Sending a request to this endpoint requires PCI DSS compliance.
        You must comply with PCI DSS data security requirements if you want to store, transmit, or process sensitive card data such as the cardholder's primary account number (PAN), personal identification number (PIN), and card expiration date.

        If you want to update a card's PIN instead, send a `PUT` request to the `/pins` endpoint.
        See <</core-api/pins#putPins, Create or Update PIN>> on this page for details.

        Revealing a card's PIN is a two-step process.
        You must first create a new control token for the card by sending a `POST` request to `/pins/controltoken`, and then use that token to reveal the PIN.

        To return an array of all of a program's users, send a `GET` request to the `/users` endpoint.
        This endpoint supports <</core-api/field-filtering, field filtering>> and <</core-api/sorting-and-pagination, pagination>>.
        To narrow your result set to users that match certain criteria, see the <<search_users,Search users>> endpoint.

        The `business_token` field is conditionally returned in the response (it cannot be set through the API).
        You can use this field in conjunction with the `parent_token` field to determine whether the user has a parent or grandparent that is a business:

        This endpoint enables you to create a user.
        A new user's initial status depends on the <</core-api/kyc-verification, Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements>> of the program or associated <</core-api/account-holder-groups, account holder group>>.

        [cols="1,1,1,1"]

        | KYC Required | Initial User Status | User Active on Creation | User Limitations

        | Always

        | Optional
        | Cannot load funds; cannot activate cards.

        | Conditionally
        | `LIMITED`
        | Optional
        | Restricted by rules in `accountholdergroups.pre_kyc_controls`.

        | Never
        | `ACTIVE`
        | Required
        | None.
        |===

        [NOTE]
        Use the `/usertransitions` endpoints to transition user resources between statuses and to view the history of a user's status.
        Do not set the value of the `user.active` field directly.
        For more information on status changes, see <</core-api/user-transitions#postUsertransitions, Create User Transition>>.

        To perform KYC verification on users, the user object must have the following fields configured:

        * `first_name` (legal first name only, no prefixes)
        * `last_name` (legal last name only, no suffixes)
        * `address1` (cannot be a PO Box)
        * `city`
        * `state`
        * `postal_code`
        * `country`
        * `birth_date`
        * `identifications`
        * `phone` (required in some cases)
        * `email` (required in some cases)

        [NOTE]
        The `identifications` requirement depends on your program's configuration.
        To determine if you should provide a full or abbreviated identification number, contact your Marqeta representative.
        KYC verification requires the full Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) of the user.

        To create a child user, you must identify the parent user or business and determine whether the child user shares an account with the parent.

        The parent must be an existing user or business.
        On the child user, set the `parent_token` field to the value of the parent's `token` field.
        If either the parent or the grandparent is a business, a `business_token` field is added to the user.
        This field's value is set to the token of either the parent or grandparent (whichever is the business).

        The `uses_parent_account` field determines whether the child shares balances with the parent (`true`) or whether the child balances are independent of the parent (`false`).
        If you do not specify a value for `uses_parent_account`, it is set to `false` by default (the user does not share the parent's balance) and returned in the response body.
        This field cannot be updated, so you must decide upon creation whether the child user shares the parent balance.

        Sharing an account with a parent user affects how the child user interacts with cards as follows:

        * A child user cannot spend funds if its parent is not active.
        * An active child user can activate cards, whether the parent is active or not.

        This endpoint returns a single-use access token.
        This type of token authorizes a single request to access API endpoints and data associated with a particular user.
        A single-use access token differs from a user access token (as returned by `POST` `/users/auth/login`) only in the number of times it can be used.

        To return a single-use access token, send a `POST` request to the `/users/auth/onetime` endpoint.
        Provide one of these sets of input data:

        * *Case #1* – Application token and user access token
        * *Case #2* – Application token, admin access token, and user token
        * *Case #3* – Application token, user's Marqeta password, and user's email address

        In each case, provide the application token as the HTTP Basic Authentication username in the request header's Authorization field.
        When applicable, provide the user access token or admin access token as the HTTP Basic Authentication password.
        When applicable, provide the user token or user's Marqeta password and email address in link:http://www.json.org/[JSON, window="_blank"] format in the request body.

        Before instantiating an embedded Marqeta widget, call this endpoint to obtain the single-use access token required as input (cases #1 and #2).

        This endpoint is also useful when you want to check a user's credentials before performing a sensitive operation without having to log out the user (case #3).

        [NOTE]
        Calling this endpoint and returning a single-use access token does not invalidate the user's current user access token.

        This endpoint enables you to change a user's status, depending on your role and the previous status change.
        By changing a user's status, you can control the user's capabilities and the setting of the `user.active` field.
        Do not set the value of the `user.active` field directly.

        |===
        | The user.status Field | Description | User Limitations

        | `UNVERIFIED`
        | Initial status of a new user belonging to an account holder group where KYC is always required.

        *Allowable Transitions:*  +
        `ACTIVE`, `CLOSED`, `TERMINATED`
        | Cannot activate cards or load funds.

        *user.active Field:*  +
        `false`

        | `LIMITED`
        | Initial status of a new user belonging to an account holder group where KYC is conditionally required.

        *Allowable Transitions:*  +
        `ACTIVE`, `SUSPENDED`, `CLOSED`
        | Restricted by rules in `accountholdergroups.pre_kyc_controls`.

        *user.active Field:*  +
        `true`

        | `ACTIVE`
        | Status of a user who has passed KYC, or initial status of a new user belonging to an account holder group where KYC is never required.

        *Allowable Transitions:*  +
        `SUSPENDED`, `CLOSED`, `UNVERIFIED`
        | None.

        *user.active Field:*  +
        `true`

        | `SUSPENDED`
        | The user is temporarily inactive.

        Transitioning a suspended user to the `ACTIVE` status is restricted, based on your role and the details of the previous status change.

        *Allowable Transitions:*  +
        `ACTIVE`, `LIMITED`, `UNVERIFIED`, `CLOSED`, `TERMINATED`
        | Cannot activate cards, load funds, or transact.

        *user.active Field:*  +
        `false`

        | `CLOSED`
        | The user is permanently inactive.

        In general, the `CLOSED` status should be terminal.
        For exceptional cases, you can transition a user to other statuses, depending on your role and the details of the previous status change.
        Contact your Marqeta representative for more information.

        *Allowable Transitions:*  +
        `ACTIVE`, `LIMITED`, `UNVERIFIED`, `SUSPENDED`, `TERMINATED`
        | Cannot activate cards, load funds, or transact.

        *user.active Field:*  +
        `false`

        | `TERMINATED`
        | The user account is permanently closed.
        Use the `TERMINATED` state to comply with regulatory requirements, such as the requirement that a user account be irreversibly closed when it does not pass Know Your Customer (KYC) verification.

        *NOTE:* `TERMINATED` is a terminal status.
        You must have the Admin or Program Manager role to transition a user to the `TERMINATED` state.
        You cannot transition a user from `TERMINATED` to any other state.
        Contact your Marqeta representative for more information.

        *Allowable Transitions:*   +
        None
        | Cannot load funds, activate cards, or transact.

        *The user.active field:*   +
        `false`

        |===

        [NOTE]
        The Marqeta platform transitions a user's status in response to certain events.
        For example, a user in the `UNVERIFIED` status is transitioned to `ACTIVE` when the user passes KYC verification.

    post:
      description: |-
        Pings your webhook endpoint.

        Send a ping request to your webhook endpoint to validate credentials and connectivity.
        Your webhook endpoint must be configured to respond.

        === Configuring your webhook endpoint

        When the Marqeta platform receives the ping request, it sends a `POST` request containing the following body to the URL of your webhook endpoint:

        [#ping-webhook-sample]
        [source,json]
        ----
        {
          "pings": [
            {
              "token": "marqeta",
              "payload": "healthcheck"
            }
          ]
        }
        ----

        To indicate that it is functioning properly, your webhook endpoint must respond with a status code of `200` (see <</developer-guides/signature-verification, Signature Verification>> for a code example that identifies a ping request).
        The response can optionally include a link:http://www.json.org/[JSON, window="_blank"]-formatted body, for example:

        [#ping-webhook-sample-2]
        [source,json]
        ----
        {"my_endpoint_status": "alive"}
        ----

        The Marqeta platform then responds to its requestor by echoing, as-is, the response code and body received from your webhook endpoint.

        === Using the ping facility

        To ping a webhook endpoint, send a `POST` request to `/webhooks/{token}/ping` and use the `token` path parameter to specify which webhook you want to reach.
        Include an empty, link:http://www.json.org/[JSON, window="_blank"]-formatted body in the request, that is:

        [#ping-webhook-sample-3]
        [source,json]
        ----
        {}
        ----

        The following chain of actions occurs during the successful execution of a ping operation:

        . The Marqeta platform receives the ping request (`POST` to `/webhooks/{token}/ping`).
        . The Marqeta platform sends a request to your webhook endpoint.
        . Your webhook endpoint responds with a status code of "200" and an optional body.
        . The Marqeta platform responds to its requestor by echoing, as-is, the response code and body it received from your webhook endpoint.

        [NOTE]
        If the customer-hosted endpoint fails to respond within five seconds, the Marqeta platform times out the request and responds with the following message body (where `<optional message>` represents additional details you can choose to include in the response):

        [#ping-webhook-sample-4]
        [source,json]
        ----
        {
          "error_message": "Webhook operation failed " + <optional message>,
          "error_code": "422600"
        }
        ----

        Failed pings are not automatically retried.

            This can occur when two delinquency state transition webhooks are sent near-simultaneously.

            For example, if a credit and a payment that bring an account current are made around the same time, two delinquency state transitions are sent very close together.
            In these cases, one of the transitions is rolled back and invalidated.
            For the transition that is rolled back, `is_rolled_back` is `true` and the transition should be ignored.

            This field is temporary and to be deprecated when out-of-order processing is addressed in a future release.

            Four-digit response code for address verification, card security code verification, or transactions.

            For account name verification, the four digits correspond with assertions that the first, middle, last, and full name of the cardholder on the Marqeta platform match the data provided by the cardholder.

            * `0` indicates no validation was performed
            * `1` indicates the match was unsuccessful (not matched)
            * `2` indicates the match was partial
            * `3` indicates the match was exact

            For example:

            [cols="2,3,3,3,3"]
            !===
            ! Code ! First Name ! Middle Name ! Last Name ! Full Name

            ! `0000`
            ! Not validated
            ! Not validated
            ! Not validated
            ! Not validated

            ! `1111`
            ! Not matched
            ! Not matched
            ! Not matched
            ! Not matched

            ! `3333`
            ! Exact match
            ! Exact match
            ! Exact match
            ! Exact match

            ! `1232`
            ! Not matched
            ! Partial match
            ! Exact match
            ! Partial match
            !===

            For address verification responses, the code is an assertion by the Marqeta platform as to whether its address verification data matches that provided by the cardholder:

            [cols="2,3,3"]
            !===
            ! Code ! Address ! Postal Code

            ! `0000`
            ! Match

            For card security verification, the code indicates whether the verification check passed and can have these possible values:

            * `0000` – Passed
            * `0001` – Did not pass

            For a transaction, the code describes the outcome of the attempted transaction.
