      The Marqeta platform provides you with a production environment and a sandbox.
      The main difference between the production and sandbox environments is that your production environment communicates with a payment card network.
      This communication allows your program's cards to pay for goods and services by initiating live transactions over the card network.

      There are two types of sandbox environments available:

      * *Public sandbox:* A single-user environment where you can begin building your program and experiment with the Marqeta platform.
      * *Private sandbox:* A multi-user environment where you can integrate your application with the Marqeta platform.

      All funds and transactions are simulated in both types of sandbox environments.

      Unlike the production environment, a sandbox does not communicate with a card network, so the cards you create within them cannot be used to conduct real-world transactions.
      Therefore, you must rely on simulated transactions in order to test all objects you create within a sandbox.
      The sandbox environments provide a set of endpoints that let you simulate various types of card network transactions, such as authorizations, reversals, and balance inquiries.
      These endpoints are available only within the sandbox, so the details on this page do not apply to production.

      To use the Simulations API for card transactions:

      * Create a card in your sandbox environment.
      * Use the `/simulations/cardtransactions/*` endpoints to simulate transaction event types. Each endpoint is its own event type.
      * Use the `/webhooks` endpoint to send optional customer notifications for system events.

      To use the Simulations API for direct deposits, see <</core-api/simulations-direct-deposits, Simulations 2.0 — Direct Deposits>>.

      [NOTE]

      This collection of requests has been saved as a YAML file for your convenience.

      All card transaction simulations endpoints share the same request/response model, as described below.

      summary: Simulate incremental authorization
      description: |-
        Use this endpoint to simulate incremental authorization transactions.
        An incremental authorization is a request to add an additional dollar amount to an ongoing prior authorization.
        This type of transaction enables you to increase the final amount authorized as conditions change or additional charges accrue.
        A common use case is adding the gratuity (an incremental authorization) to the original total (a prior authorization) of a restaurant bill.

        For this use case, you use two endpoints: one to create the authorization, and another to increment it.

        * Create the authorization using the `/simulations/cardtransactions/authorization` endpoint:  +
        *Action:* `POST`  +
        *Endpoint:* `/simulations/cardtransactions/authorization`
        * Increment the authorization using the `/simulations/cardtransactions/authorization.incremental` endpoint:  +
        *Action:* `POST`  +
        *Endpoint:* `/simulations/cardtransactions/authorization.incremental`

      summary: Simulate refund authorization
      description: |-
        Online refund refers to the `refund.authorization` messages that Visa and Mastercard merchants can send to card issuers.
        These refund authorizations allow merchants to notify customers of a pending refund and give card issuers the opportunity to decline a refund.
        Like purchase authorizations, refund authorizations are eventually cleared or completed by a `refund.authorization.clearing` event.
        That refund authorization clearing is automatically accepted and processed by the Marqeta platform, regardless of your funding model.

      description: |-
        Use this endpoint to simulate PIN-debit authorization transactions.
        The typical use case for dual-message PIN-debit transactions is automated fuel dispenser transactions.
        The pump sends an initial authorization message to the card issuer.
        When fueling completes, a clearing message is sent with the final amount.
